        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi there, My name is Yana, and it is very nice meeting you! I am proud Ukrainian. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in International Business. It was my parents choice - at age 17 I did not have a word to
say. Right after completing my degree, I moved to the USA. My most recent work experience was an office
administrator in a construction equipment rental company and as well as for a roofing company. At some point I
started to see that I could not progress and I wanted to change my career path. A few of my friends advised me to
look into the IT field because they really enjoyed their jobs and they ALL were advancing in their companies
quickly. As of today, I am 100% committed to building my Software Developing career. I would not consider any other opportunity
now. I want to be someone who makes the difference in the field.
