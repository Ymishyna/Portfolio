                    Hi there, My name is Yana, and it is very nice meeting you! I am proud Ukrainian. I have a
                    Bachelorâ€™s
                    degree in International Business. It was my parents choice - at age 17 I did not have a word to
                    say. Right after completing my degree, I moved to the USA. My most recent work experience was an
                    office
                    administrator in a construction equipment rental company and as well as for a roofing company. At
                    some
                    point I
                    started to see that I could not progress and I wanted to change my career path. A few of my friends
                    advised me to
                    look into the IT field because they really enjoyed their jobs and they ALL were advancing in their
                    companies
                    quickly. As of today, I am 100% committed to building my Software Developing career. I would not
                    consider any other opportunity
                    now. I want to be someone who makes the difference in the field.
