                    <p>Hi there, My name is Yana, and it is very nice meeting you!</p>
                    <p>I am proud Ukrainian. I have a
                        Bachelor’s
                        degree in International Business. It was my parents choice - at age 17 I did not have a word to
                        say. Right after completing my degree, I moved to the USA. My most recent work experience was an
                        office
                        administrator in a construction equipment rental company and as well as for a roofing company.
                        At
                        some
                        point I
                        started to see that I could not progress and I wanted to change my career path. A few of my
                        friends
                        advised me to
                        look into the IT field because they really enjoyed their jobs and they ALL were advancing in
                        their
                        companies
                        quickly. </p>
                    <p>As of today, I am 100% committed to building my Software Developing career. I would not
                        consider any other opportunity
                        now. I want to be someone who makes the difference in the field.
                    </p>
